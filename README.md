Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn simplifies the process of creating visualizations by offering functions to create various types of plots with fewer lines of code.

Bar Plot

A bar plot is a visualization that represents categorical data with rectangular bars. The height or length of each bar corresponds to the frequency or value of the category it represents. It's commonly used to compare values across different categories.

Point Plot
A point plot displays point estimates and confidence intervals using scatterplot markers. It's useful for showing the central tendency and variability of a numeric variable for different levels of categorical variables.

Joint Plot

A joint plot in Seaborn combines multiple kinds of plots to visualize the joint distribution of two variables along with their individual distributions. It typically includes scatter plots, histograms, and kernel density estimations (KDE).

Pie Chart

A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic that is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. Each slice represents a proportionate part of the whole dataset. It's suitable for showing the composition of a categorical variable.

Lm Plot
The lmplot() function in Seaborn creates a scatter plot with a linear regression line fit to the data. It's useful for visualizing the relationship between two variables and estimating the linear regression model between them.

Kde Plot

A KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plot visualizes the probability density function of a continuous random variable. It represents the distribution of data by smoothing out the histogram and creating a continuous curve.

Violin Plot

A violin plot combines a box plot with a KDE plot. It shows the distribution of quantitative data across several levels of one or more categorical variables. The width of the "violin" indicates the data density at different values.

Heatmap Plot

A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values in a matrix are represented as colors. It's often used to visualize correlations in a dataset by assigning different colors to different intensity values.

Box Plot

A box plot (box-and-whisker plot) displays the distribution of quantitative data through quartiles. It shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the dataset, providing a concise summary of the data's distribution.

Swarm Plot
A swarm plot displays categorical data with points along an axis. Points do not overlap, making it easy to visualize the distribution of data points within categories.

Pair Plot

A pair plot in Seaborn generates a grid of scatterplots and histograms for pairwise relationships in a dataset. It helps visualize relationships between all pairs of variables in a dataset.

Count Plot

A count plot is a simple bar plot that displays the count of observations in each category of a categorical variable. It's useful for showing the frequency of occurrences within categories.

FacetGrid

FacetGrid is a Seaborn class that allows the creation of multi-plot grids based on a categorical variable. It's useful for visualizing relationships across multiple categorical variables by creating separate subplots for each category.

Strip Plot

A strip plot is similar to a scatter plot but is specifically used for categorical data. It displays the distribution of data points as individual points spread out along an axis, making it easy to see the density of points within categories.

Factor Plot

The factorplot() function in Seaborn is used to create categorical plots. It's a generalization of several other plot types (like point plots, bar plots, etc.) and can be used to create different types of categorical plots by specifying the kind parameter.

DisPlot

The displot() function in Seaborn is used to visualize the distribution of univariate data (data with only one variable). It combines histogram and KDE plots to show the distribution of values.

Line Plot

A line plot displays data points connected by straight lines. It's useful for showing trends and changes in data over continuous intervals or time.

Despine

Despine() is a Seaborn function that removes the top and right spines from a plot, improving its aesthetics without removing the entire axis. It's used for creating cleaner visualizations.

Seaborn offers a wide range of tools for data visualization, making it a popular choice for analysts and data scientists due to its simplicity and aesthetic appeal in creating compelling visualizations.
